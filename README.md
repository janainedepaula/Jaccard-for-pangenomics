# Jaccard-Coefficient-analysis-for-PPanGGoLiN-gene-presence-absence
Computing similarity, distance matrices, and hierarchical clustering for pangenome data

This repository provides an R script to compute the Jaccard similarity coefficient between bacterial lineages using the gene_presence_absence.csv file derived from PPanGGoLiN.
The script calculates: 1. A Jaccard similarity matrix; 2. a distance matrix (1 – Jaccard) and 3. a hierarchical clustering dendrogram based on gene content similarity.

# This approach is particularly useful for comparative genomics, pangenome structure analysis, and studying CDS sharing patterns among bacterial genomes.

------------------------------
# Input Requirements:
The script expects a gene presence/absence table generated by PPanGGoLiN (gene_presence_absence.csv)
-> Table format:
  - Each row = gene family (CDS cluster);
  - Each column = genome/lineage;
  - 1 = gene present;
  - 0 = gene absent.

# Understanding the Jaccard Coefficient
The Jaccard coefficient measures the similarity between two sets. In a pangenome context:
-> Intersection (shared CDS): genes present in both genomes.
-> Union (total CDS): genes present in at least one genome.

Formula: J(A,B) = ∣A∪B∣ / ∣A∩B∣​
A value close to 1 indicates strong similarity and many shared CDS.
